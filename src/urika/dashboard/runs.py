"""Subprocess spawn helpers for browser-launched agent runs.

The dashboard kicks off CLI commands (``urika run``, ``urika finalize``,
``urika present``) as detached subprocesses whose stdout/stderr write
directly to a log file on disk; SSE log tailers read that file. Each
spawn writes a ``.lock`` file alongside its log; a daemon reaper thread
removes the lock when the subprocess exits, so SSE tailers can detect
completion.

The subprocess is started in a new session (``start_new_session=True``
on POSIX, ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` on Windows) and its stdout goes
straight to a file rather than through a pipe. That means a dashboard
restart (Ctrl+C → restart, or even SIGKILL of uvicorn) does not kill
running experiments: there is no pipe to receive SIGPIPE, and the child
is not in the dashboard's process group so terminal Ctrl+C does not
propagate to it.
